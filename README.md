### Part 1: Searching for books

In `index.html`, you will see a list of books and a search bar.

Your task is to hook up the search bar so that we can filter through a list of books. When the user starts typing into the search bar, the books on the page should filter so that we are only seeing ones with a matching title to the user's search term.

### Part 2: Finding the most common genre

In `main.js`, write a function that finds the genre that is the most common among the books on the page.

### Part 3: Helping students

Where in the above tasks do you think a student who is just learning JS would struggle? What are some ways you would help them along? Answer in `part-3.md`.
